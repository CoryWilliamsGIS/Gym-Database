# Gym-Database

The code contained in this repository was created as part of the assessment for  **CEGEG129: SPATIAL DATABASES AND DATA MANAGEMENT**, as part of the MSc Geographic Information Science (GIS) course at University College London.

The first assignment ([pdf](https://github.com/CoryWilliamsGIS/Gym-Database/blob/master/CEGEG129%20-%20Assignment%201.pdf)) for this module involved the database design. A detailed description and documented, conceptual Entity-Relationship Diagram using UML notation was presented. 

The second assignment ([pdf](https://github.com/CoryWilliamsGIS/Gym-Database/blob/master/CEGEG129%20-%20Assignment%202.pdf)) involved the database creation. A logical Entity-Relation Diagram was presented, before SQL scripts were written to create the database with appropriate constraints. Functional queries were scripted to return information appropriate to the system.
